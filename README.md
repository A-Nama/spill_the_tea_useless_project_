### Project Description
Spill the Tea is like Mean Girls meets Bridgerton! Share your juiciest drama anonymously, choose the level of flair, and watch as we turn it into a captivating tale. Plus, you can dive into the best anonymous dramas from others‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a little juicy gossip?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We‚Äôre solving the age-old dilemma of not having a place to air your drama without the fear of judgment! Why bottle up your juicy stories when you can spill them anonymously? Think of us as your drama therapist but with a twist of fun and no awkward conversations

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We're solving it by creating a platform where you can unleash your inner storyteller! With 'Spill the Tea,' you simply hop on, share your drama from a third-person perspective‚Äîno names, no shame‚Äîand choose how dramatic you want it to be. We take that and turn it into a dramatized masterpiece! Plus, you get to read all the deliciously anonymous teas from others. It's like a drama-filled playground where everyone can enjoy the thrill of gossip without any consequences!
